# teen

`teen` pages are like `man` pages but for HTTP status codes. Most web developers spend some time looking at response codes (usually errors) and then Googling what they mean. But with `teen`, you can simply run `$ teen [status_code]` and get a quick explanation of your HTTP response â€“ without leaving the terminal.

## Installation

Teen works on MacOS, Linux, and Windows (if you use Cygwin), with compiled binaries available for [every release](https://github.com/shobrook/teen/releases). You can also install it with pip:

`$ pip install teen`

Requires Python 3.0 or higher.

## Contributing

Eventually, I'd like to turn this project into the go-to manual for everything HTTP-related.<!--Provide an example of how this could be expanded into, say, request headers.--> If you'd like to be a part of that, please feel free to make a contribution. Just fork the repo, make your changes and then submit a pull request. If you do contribute, please try to adhere to the existing style.

If you've discovered a bug or have a feature request, create an [issue](https://github.com/shobrook/teen/issues/new) and I'll take care of it!
